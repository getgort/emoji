# Emoji

This library provides a way to convert from unicode emoji to common shortnames used by chat platforms, and from
shortnames to unicode. This is useful for applications dealing with multiple chat providers that handle emoji in
different ways. (Like [Gort](https://github.com/getgort/gort)!)

## Todo
* Better error handling: right now invalid input results in an empty emoji with no warning.
* Add support for custom, platform-defined emoji.
* Documentation.
